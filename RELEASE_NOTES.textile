h1. Ripple Release Notes

h2. 0.5 Initial Release - 2010-02-10

This is the first release of Ripple, which would not have been possible
without the generous support of Sonian and Basho Technologies.  Many thanks.
It includes:

* A robust basic client, @Riak@, with:
** multiple HTTP backends (curb, net/http)
** sensible client defaults (local, default port)
** bucket access and manipulation, including key-streaming
** object reading, storing, deleting and reloading
** automatic de-serialization of JSON, YAML, and Marshal (when given the right content type)
** streaming POST/PUT bodies (when given an IO)
** method-chained map-reduce job construction
* A document-style modeling library, Ripple, with:
** ActiveModel 3.0 compatibility
** Property/attribute definition with automatic type-casting
** Bucket selection based on class name, with single-bucket inheritance (configurable)
** Validations
** Dirty-tracking
** Simple finders - all documents, by key
** Reloading
